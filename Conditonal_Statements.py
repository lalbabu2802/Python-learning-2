# Conditional Statement :
# in Python perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specific
# Boolean constraint evaluates to true or false. Conditional statements are handled by IF statements in Python.


# What is If Statement? How to Use it?
# In Python, If Statement is used for decision making. It will run the body of code only when IF statement is true.
# When you want to justify one condition while the other condition is not true, then you use "if statement".
# Syntax:
# if expression
#  Statement
# else
#  Statement

# SWITCH STATEMENT
# A switch statement is a multiway branch statement that compares the value of
# a variable to the values specified in case statements.
# Python language doesnâ€™t have a switch statement.
# Python uses dictionary mapping to implement switch statement in Python
